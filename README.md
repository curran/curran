Here's some of my work in VizHub, a dataviz platform I started in 2018 to help teach courses and continue to maintain and grow as a SaaS business for professionals. The code editor in VizHub is the open source project [VZCode](https://github.com/vizhub-core/vzcode).

Here are some videos about VizHub:

A contour map visualization of population density across the
world, estimated based on populations of large cities.
Features panning & zooming, and a label placement algorithm
that uses an R-Tree spatial index to avoid overlaps.

A circle pack visualization of a subset of the DBPedia
ontology, a hierarchical taxonomy of classes that categorize
Wikipedia articles. Features panning and zooming, color
pased on depth, and gradients that make the circles look
like 3D spheres. Clicking on a circle will take you to a
list of all Wikipedia articles about the topic.

## Testimonials

Here are some things folks have to say about me:

---

**Logan Williams**  
*Data science lead at Bellingcat*  
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-williams-5957b229/)

> "Curran is the most systematic thinker of data visualizations that I have met â€” his perspective will change the way you think about representing data and give you practical tools for exploring your ideas."

<!-- ![Andy Davies](https://via.placeholder.com/150) -->
**Andy Davies**  
*Design Principal, The London Stock Exchange*  
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adsevenfour/)

> "Curran has a wonderful, enthusiastic, optimistic and dedicated approach to everything he does which is infectious. He is incredibly knowledgable - probably underplaying his capabilities - in all things based around front end dataviz development. Always keen to experiment and explore new ways of working with the wider team creating an inclusive and collaborative environment which is sometimes lacking from wider project / product teams.
>
> Curran is also one of the best teachers I have had in terms of explaining front end complexity. He has a natural ability to match your level of knowledge and then work with you to understand the nuances that just make something click. I learnt I lot in our time together, even recording training sessions where I could ask questions, not really understand, but play back later.
> 
> It was honestly a pleasure to work with him and I can't recommend him highly enough. I'll also add my total collaboration was remote and in different timezones, making this doubly impressive. On the occasion we did meet, it was like meeting an old friend.
> Just hire him / work with him / get on a call with him, you'll see."

**Louis Parizeau**  
*Co-Founder, Highgate Analytics*  
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louis-parizeau-6b0510156/)

> "Curran quickly understood my complex codebase, and was able to fix many of my visualization's bugs that I couldn't find solutions for online. Additionally, he gave specific, best-practice advice to improve the load time, UI responsiveness, and maintainability of my D3 implementation. Curran was great to work with and I would 100% recommend him to anyone stuck with D3 bugs, or looking to refactor their code to follow best practices."

*Founder, Thunnus Tech*  
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucio-biase/)

> "Curran is experienced, creative, humorous and very knowledgeable. We needed to jumpstart our development of the manipulation of data visualization and he was one of three experts we could find globally. Tired of iterations and delays flew up to sit with him. He was initially incredulous of having a new client look over his shoulder for a week but true to character he was open minded. Strangers became colleagues and became fast friends, the week flew by and not only was the work product fantastic so was his openness and willingness to empower our tech team."
