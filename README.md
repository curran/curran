## Testimonials

Here are some things folks have to say about me:

> Curran Kelleher has taught graduate level courses in data visualization.  He can produce great work and teach others to do so too!
> â€” [Mike Ahern, Director, Academic & Corporate Engagement + Adjunct Instructor, Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-ahern-85951a56/)

> Curran quickly understood my complex codebase, and was able to fix many of my visualization's bugs that I couldn't find solutions for online. Additionally, he gave specific, best-practice advice to improve the load time, UI responsiveness, and maintainability of my D3 implementation. Curran was great to work with and I would 100% recommend him to anyone stuck with D3 bugs, or looking to refactor their code to follow best practices.
